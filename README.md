# Hotel Scraper - Technical Test

Web application for scraping hotel data from Booking.com with a React frontend and Django REST API backend.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Clone and run with Docker:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dmartin-projects/athlos-technical-test.git
   cd athlos-technical-test
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:80
   - Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs/

### Cloud Deploy

App deployed on Choreo.  

You can test this app at this [link](https://3b94243c-3966-4999-831b-ee2d97f5d397.e1-eu-north-azure.choreoapps.dev/).

> Note: Choreo provides a free Postgres database with cold start.  
> This means it shuts down every hour, and the server admin has to restart it manually.  
> You will be able to test the first endpoint (scraping booking information), but not the endpoints that depend on the database.

>Due to the limitations of Choreoâ€™s free version, it is not possible to use the Selenium function for the image scraper. 
>Choreo does not allow writing to the file system after deployment, so in production the app cannot save or scrape images from Booking.

## Architecture
